I am a junior-level software engineer specializing in Python programming, with a focus on backend development using frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and DB Browser for SQLite. I also have some experience with frontend web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am skilled in collaborative work on GitHub, where Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience working in teams.
In addition, I am comfortable working in Linux, macOS, and Windows environments, and I possess strong technical and soft skills in remote sensing, satellite geodesy, and atmospheric modeling. I am highly creative, eager to learn from others, and have expanded my professional network on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed.
 
 I holds a PhD in Atmospheric Physics from Bahir Dar University, where he specialized in atmospheric modeling and GNSS data interpretation. Throughout my career, I have excelled in teaching undergraduate and graduate courses, developing educational materials, and guiding research projects in geodesy and GNSS atmospheric modeling. My robust technical proficiency includes programming in Python, MATLAB, and web development technologies, complemented by strong computing skills in both Linux and Windows environments.

Currently, I am advancing my software engineering capabilities through a Back-end development bootcamp in Berlin, where he is enhancing his expertise in algorithms and problem-solving. My portfolio includes notable projects like a command-line MovieApp and the Zootopia information repository, both demonstrating his ability to apply programming skills in practical applications. A licensed surveyor and geospatial analyst, I have also contributed to various publications and conferences, showcasing his commitment to advancing knowledge in atmospheric science and geospatial technologies. He is eager to leverage his interdisciplinary background in software development 
to drive innovative solutions in technology and science. For more information on his professional journey, visit his LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
